DoPHOT is a point spread function fitting (PSF) photometry program. Some relevant details of the PSF fitting are discussed. The quality of the photometry returned by DoPHOT is assessed via reductions of an 'artificial' globular cluster generated from a list with well known magnitudes and colors. Results from comparative tests between DoPHOT and DAOPHOT using this synthetic cluster and real data are also described. (SECTION: Instrumentation and Data Analysis)
