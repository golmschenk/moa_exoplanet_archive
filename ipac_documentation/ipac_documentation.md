Software Used to Create the Dataset

DoPHOT

DoPHOT is a common point spread function fitting (PSF) photometry program. DoPHOT uses a analytical function (a polynomial approximation to a 2-D Gaussian) to represent stellar profiles.

The MOA dataset consists of two components. A collection of light curves, each of a which is a table of data, and the table of the metadata for all the light curves. Each row in each light curve table corresponds to a moment in time, and the related measurements and derived values for that moment in time. Each row in the metadata table corresponds to a light curve. There is one row in the metadata table for each light curve in the dataset.
